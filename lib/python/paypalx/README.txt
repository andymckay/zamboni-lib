This is a file from:

https://github.com/paypalx/python-signature-generator-for-authentication-header/blob/master/org/paypalx/genPermissionsAuthHeader.py

It wasn't in an easily importable form (being in a directory called org). So I copied into this directory.
Note that it does not also specify any license or copyright in the directory on github.

Hopefully we'll be able to rewrite this with a bit more time.
